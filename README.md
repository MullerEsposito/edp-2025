# âš¡ Ethereum Developer Pack (EDP) â€” Bootcamp Projects

---

## ðŸ“– Overview

This repository contains all the projects developed during the **Ethereum Developer Pack (EDP)** bootcamp â€” a complete learning journey focused on **blockchain development** using **Solidity**, **smart contracts**, and **Ethereum-based tools**.

Each project within this repository represents a milestone in the learning process, covering topics such as:
- Smart contract design and security
- Decentralized application (dApp) development
- Deployment to Ethereum test networks (e.g., Sepolia, Goerli)
- Usage of Remix IDE, Hardhat, and MetaMask
- CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol)
